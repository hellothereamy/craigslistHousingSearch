Unfortunately my flat has no garage, but street parking is available, although a pain if you plan on driving every day. This unit has one .75 bath, has a shower stall only, no tub so it is a .75 bath and one .5 bath with custom asian style bidets installed in both toilets! My flat will be available around July 3rd. Asian style home, so requesting shoes off! There is a locked hallway closet that I will use exclusively to store my stuff until I move back to the bay area. This hallway closet I am using will be locked, so you will not have access to it. I'm asking for $3500 including water and garbage (NO electric, gas, internet, cable TV etc.). First, last month and one month security deposit required. In the laundry room area, unfortunately there is a leak coming from the exterior wall siding not done correctly. I would kindly ask if you do rent my place, to help clean up the water leaking from the wall on to the floor during heavy rainy days. It will not be repaired for a while because our condo association just installed a new roof, so the cost of replacing the siding will take some time before we replenish our condo finances. This flat has a small backyard shared by 2 other owners upstairs (both professional couples). Furnished with 3 flat screen TV's (one TV with internet apps and one older 720p flat screen), and another relatively new 1080p flat screen I use as a computer monitor, one b&w laser printer, one inkjet printer, 5.1 stereo surround system, computer workstation desk I am really looking for a responsible couple who will take care of my home while I am away for a year and will give my old Victorian flat a lot of TLC.
