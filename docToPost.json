All stainless steel appliances, Brazilian hardwood floors, granite counter tops, and wine storage. Located at the corner of Sansome and Pine Streets in the true heart of the financial district. The landmark Royal Insurance Building was the first commercial building completed downtown after the 1906 quake. Designed by New York City Architects Howell and Stokes, the building features a Georgian Revival brick and stone exterior and imported Italian marble. In 2006, the building was converted to exquisite residential condos. This gorgeous building is home to 46 luxury residences collectively known as The Royal. Enjoy San Francisco's finest from this luxury penthouse at The Royal in the heart of the Financial District. Many of the City's finest attractions and eateries are within steps of your front door. Downtown San Francisco perspectives frame every room of the residence. The formal entry transitions to a livable open floor plan, a gracious entertaining space perfectly poised for intimate gatherings at home. A well-appointed gourmet kitchen and living and dining room combination comprise the main living areas, while a spacious half bath complete the first floor of the home. The master bedroom and ensuite bathroom, and second bed and bath offer restful private personal accommodations on the second floor. Handsome hardwood floors move throughout, with sleek bath tile, and natural stone countertops converging to emanate an atmosphere of quality throughout. Now known as The Royal, this treasured landmark was originally designed as an 11-story commercial building. Conceptualized by Heller Manus Architects, the building has been thoughtfully transformed into a 12-story residential building housing 46 luxury condominiums. The historical facade, entryway, lobby and stairway were all restored to their original magnificence, with the European marble and stone details of the interior common areas carefully conserved to retain the historic integrity of the building. A hallmark Financial District presence, The Royal was first known as the Royal Globe Insurance Building. Presently, the building is respectfully referred to as San Francisco Historic Landmark #160. Completed in 1909, this one of a kind residence also holds the distinction of being the first fully fire resistant building constructed after the 1906 earthquake. Many of the buildings original details were preserved with great appreciation for their original grandeur, while modern elements including additional storage and a common rooftop deck boasting stunning Downtown views were added to further enhance the building. A rare opportunity to enjoy a taste of historic City living balanced with the contemporary appeal of a newly renovated residence, this special property is perfectly poised as a launchpad for a blissful San Francisco Summer.

In the homes you'll find high ceilings, gorgeous floors and a personal exterior entrance with access to a peaceful and elegantly designed central courtyard. It is on South Park, a quiet and special piece of San Francisco history, just steps from AT&T Park. Neighborhood: One of the most prominent features of South Beach is AT&T Park, home of the World Champion San Francisco Giants. The presence of this ballpark has enticed many new services and restaurants into the area, most notably chef Michael Mina's RN74, Ironside, and Tres. Wine bars also abound, like Local Kitchen & Wine Merchant and District Wine Bar. Since South Beach is a quick walk to the Ferry Building Marketplace, weekly shopping at the Farmer's Market is a must. On your way down the Embarcadero, check out Pat Kuleto's Waterbar and Epic Roasthouse. You'll be glad you did.

Unfortunately my flat has no garage, but street parking is available, although a pain if you plan on driving every day. This unit has one .75 bath, has a shower stall only, no tub so it is a .75 bath and one .5 bath with custom asian style bidets installed in both toilets! My flat will be available around July 3rd. Asian style home, so requesting shoes off! There is a locked hallway closet that I will use exclusively to store my stuff until I move back to the bay area. This hallway closet I am using will be locked, so you will not have access to it. I'm asking for $3500 including water and garbage (NO electric, gas, internet, cable TV etc.). First, last month and one month security deposit required. In the laundry room area, unfortunately there is a leak coming from the exterior wall siding not done correctly. I would kindly ask if you do rent my place, to help clean up the water leaking from the wall on to the floor during heavy rainy days. It will not be repaired for a while because our condo association just installed a new roof, so the cost of replacing the siding will take some time before we replenish our condo finances. This flat has a small backyard shared by 2 other owners upstairs (both professional couples). Furnished with 3 flat screen TV's (one TV with internet apps and one older 720p flat screen), and another relatively new 1080p flat screen I use as a computer monitor, one b&w laser printer, one inkjet printer, 5.1 stereo surround system, computer workstation desk I am really looking for a responsible couple who will take care of my home while I am away for a year and will give my old Victorian flat a lot of TLC.
